# Job Advertisement Portal

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Overview
The aim of the project is to create a job advertisement portal that is responsive, easy to use, and accelerates the process of creating work opportunities. The platform allows verified customers to post and engage with job listings securely. Once an offer has been accepted, the employer and employee can directly communicate.

The portal will display job offers on the main page with the option to filter by location. Data security and privacy are of utmost importance, ensuring secure handling of user information and transaction details.
